# Elemental
A very similar cheat to Assault-Black but this time it's internal

**Description**

'Elemental' is a more advanced version of the external cheat 'Assault Black.' Elemental is an internal version and is replacing Assault Black pretty much before it started.

**V0.0 of Elemental Fetures**

1. Infinate Health (only works in offline) - gives player 120 health if there is any lost

2. Auto BHOP - jumps everytime you hit the ground which prevents friction, you can go really fast like this

3. Yaw Snap - snaps yaw / player rotation to multiples of 45ยบ

4. Infinate Rilfe Magazine Ammo (only works in offline) - gives the rifle 50 bullets for ever

5. Infinate Grenades (only works in offline) - gives the player 5 grenades for ever

I want to keep adding hack to it like Aimbot and Strafe(working on)
